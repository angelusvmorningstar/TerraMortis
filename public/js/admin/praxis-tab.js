/**
 * Praxis Claim board - the ST's live tap-to-assign board for Praxis night
 * (Epic PRAX, story prax.2).
 *
 * ═══ ST-ONLY, PERMANENTLY ═══
 *
 * Reached only through admin.html's existing ST-only sidebar and auth gate,
 * the same posture as every other admin domain, and every route it calls is
 * `requireRole('st')` server-side (see server/routes/praxis-sessions.js's own
 * header). There is deliberately NO extra client-side role check here: adding
 * one would imply this module could ever be mounted somewhere player-reachable,
 * which is exactly the thing the epic's locked ruling forbids.
 *
 * ═══ PURE CONSUMER ═══
 *
 * Every route used here shipped in prax.1 and is untouched by this story. This
 * module opens and withdraws claims, assigns and unassigns supporters, and
 * refetches on the `praxis_session` WS frame. It does not resolve a winner
 * (prax.4a/prax.4b own that) and never calls a resolve route, because none
 * exists yet.
 *
 * ═══ THE TALLY IS NEVER STORED ═══
 *
 * The board document persists only claims and support assignments. Every number
 * on screen is computed at render time from live character + territory data via
 * `calcCityStatus()`, never read off the document. `setStatusTerritories()` is
 * therefore primed from `/api/territories` BEFORE any tally is computed -
 * `calcCityStatus` resolves the regent-ambience component out of that
 * module-local store, so an unprimed store silently costs claimants their
 * regency bonus rather than failing loudly.
 *
 * ═══ DUAL TALLY (prax.3) ═══
 *
 * prax.3 delivered the parameterisation this file's constant-at-the-top design
 * was built for: the tally literal became `_activeTally` module state, switched
 * by the segmented control in the header, and every accessor and write action
 * below reads it rather than a fixed string. There is deliberately no second
 * board module - one component serves both tallies.
 *
 * The two tallies are NEVER coupled. A character may hold an open claim, or a
 * support assignment, in both at once - that is a supported state, not an
 * oversight (see prax.1's own POST /claims comment). The only cross-tally read
 * anywhere is cosmetic: the summary row's two leaders and the pool chips' two
 * dots, both computed against `_board.praxis` AND `_board.harpy` on every
 * render regardless of which tally is active.
 *
 * The two weightings are genuinely different, not a shared formula with a
 * parameter. Praxis is a City Status sum (claimant's own, plus every
 * supporter's). Harpy is a plain unweighted headcount of supporters assigned to
 * the claimant, with NO baseline for the claimant themselves: the epic's locked
 * ruling is that nothing auto-adds a Harpy claimant as their own first vote.
 * They can still be assigned to themselves through the ordinary support flow,
 * which then counts as one vote like anyone else's.
 *
 * ═══ RESOLVING THE HARPY TALLY (prax.4a) ═══
 *
 * prax.4a adds the ONE action that makes a result real: "Declare Winner" per
 * claimant card, and a board-level "Dismiss vote". Both call the single new
 * route, which performs the seat handover and freezes `resolved.harpy` in one
 * transaction. Once that field is set the Harpy tab's LIVE section (the pool
 * strip and the claimant cards) is replaced by a read-only summary, and the two
 * actions stop rendering - there is nothing left to assign.
 *
 * Three things about that, all deliberate:
 *
 *   - NO CONFIRM MODAL on either action, and NO UNDO. Locked at design-lock: a
 *     mistaken resolve is corrected by hand afterwards through the existing
 *     Court panel, not through a reversal path here. A real undo would have to
 *     precisely reverse the server's destroyed-XP counter, and a half-correct
 *     one would be worse than none. The toast is pure confirmation.
 *   - The OUTGOING holder is read from `_seats` BEFORE the write, because the
 *     response deliberately carries no seat or character data and by the time
 *     the toast is composed the seat has already changed hands.
 *   - Only the HARPY tally is resolvable through that flow. The Praxis tally
 *     has its own, below.
 *
 * ═══ RESOLVING THE PRAXIS TALLY (prax.4b) ═══
 *
 * prax.4b gives the Praxis tally the same two actions and one more component:
 * a CONFIRM MODAL between "Declare Winner" and the request.
 *
 * That is a deliberate departure from the Harpy flow above, not an
 * inconsistency. A Harpy resolve hands over ONE seat, and the person losing it
 * is standing in the room. A Praxis resolve mass-clears EVERY Enforcer,
 * Administrator and City Harpy seat at once - offices belonging to people who
 * are not watching this board and did not know it was about to happen. The
 * modal names each of them before anything is written; a mass-clear is never
 * pretended to be undoable, and there is no Undo here either.
 *
 * Three more things about it, all deliberate:
 *
 *   - THE CONFIRM LIST IS THE CAS BASELINE. The exact seat ids the modal
 *     displayed are sent back on the request, and the server re-verifies them
 *     against a live query inside its own transaction. A 409 from that check
 *     re-renders THIS SAME MODAL from the fresh list the error carries, rather
 *     than closing back to the board - the ST reviews what changed and can
 *     confirm again immediately.
 *   - The two resolve flows share `showToast` and `renderResolvedSummary`,
 *     parameterised by tally rather than duplicated. Everything that differs
 *     between them is a lookup in one of the TALLY_* maps at the top of this
 *     file.
 *   - The two tallies still never influence each other's render. A resolved
 *     Praxis tab and a live Harpy tab (or the reverse) is an ordinary state.
